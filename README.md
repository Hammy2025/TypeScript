# TypeScript
Some code that I've done with TypeScript. Thus folder includes a Discord Bot project that I worked on for my class. This Discord Bot assigns and removes roles in a classroom setting, as well as adding roles and creating semesters of a college classroom. The Discord Bot was worked on by me and my two classmates, Jakob and Matthew.
